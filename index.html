                <p>Because as much as you love good design and inspiring illustrations, you also want to meet the people
                    that curate all the content for you.

                    Furthermore, it’s equally rewarding when you realize that they are just as eager to start a visual
                    dialogue with you.

                    Nathan Strandberg and Katie Kirk are doing what makes them happy, and this is obvious throughout
                    their page.</p>
